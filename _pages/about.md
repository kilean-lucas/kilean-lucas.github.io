I started my career at Montana State University where I pursued a dual degree in chemical engineering and biological engineering. During my time at MSU, I participated in research at the Imaging and Chemical Analysis Lab, where I studied microbially influenced corrosion in fuel/seawater environments for a project funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). My work resulted in multiple presentations and publications in the field of corrosion science and I developed expertise in numerous metrology techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron microscopy. I also developed strong microbiology skills, particularly in the area of anaerobic bacteria and working with the systems and equipment necessary to handle them.

After graduating, I decided to pursue a PhD in biomedical engineering at the University of Rochester. During my rotations, I was asked to work on a novel project to capture and analyze extracellular vesicles for potential diagnostic applications. I was able to apply my expertise in metrology to identify potential drawbacks with the plan to purify these nanoscale particles and quickly developed a new method to isolate them from the highly complex protein solution that is blood plasma. I was fortunate to be able to pursue this project for the remainder of my graduate work and my project led to two patents and multiple publications in the field of separation science and extracellular vesicles. Along the way, I developed expertise in molecular biology, nanofabrication, microfluidic device design and fabrication and filtration science. I presented my work at the Falling Walls Lab conference in Berlin, Germany after winning the regional Falling Walls competition, and collaborated with scientists across the globe to develop methods to purify and analyze these extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, I chaired the Gordon Research Seminar on Extracellular Vesicles in 2022 (delayed from 2020), where we discussed groundbreaking work in the field of extracellular vesicle research.

After I graduated, I did a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital under Dr. Ralph Weissleder. I was interested in furthering my expertise in cell biology and systems biology, so I came up with a project to develop a multiplexed mRNA fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH) method for spatial transcriptomics. My goal was to have a system that implemented the cyclic chemistry methods used in the Weissleder lab to analyze multiple genes within tumors using only four fluorophores. During this work, I implemented a microfluidic system that allowed researchers performing cyclic imaging to save reagents by minimizing the volume used per label and wash cycle. I also worked on microfluidic methods for in vivo cyclic imaging in brain tumors. I also invented a method for performing cyclic antibody and mRNA FISH staining at concurrently, which can be seen on my projects page.

After my postdoctoral fellowship, I worked for a company called T2Biosystems as a process development scientist. The company manufactured molecular assays and instruments for sepsis tests in whole blood and my focus was on the optimization of scalable manufacturing for the assay as well as the development of new test methods for detecting contamination due to the sensitivity of the assay. During my time at T2, I led projects to develop a incoming materials clean test (as many sepsis bacteria are common environmental microbes) as well as led troubleshooting efforts for numerous contamination events that affected manufacturing of the reagent. Furthermore, I led a project to identify numerous drawbacks with manufacturing that were leading to invalid assays, including an analysis of the lysis tube filling process, which was resulting in underfilled tubes and creating assay invalids. I identified the root cause for an assay failure in the T2Resistance panel, where the conditions of thermocycling were not optimal for the assay, resulting in assay invalids. During my work at T2, I gained significant experience in writing corrective and preventative actions, deviations, authoring standard operating procedures, work instructions, and batch records, as well as completely overhauled the risk assessment methods in use (including failure modes and effects analysis). I led projects with two suppliers to identify the presence of contaminating DNA in the product that they were sending us, one of which resulted in saving over $400,000 in raw material costs. I led the development of methods to reduce the scrappage of manufactured materials as well as multiple training sessions for manufacturing personnel to ensure that proper aseptic technique was used during reagent manufacturing.
